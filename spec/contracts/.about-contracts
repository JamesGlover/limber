This follows the testing pattern established in the sequencescape-client-api itself

A contract composes two files:
- retrieve-contract-name
- contract name

The former lists the expected headers/content of the request
The later includes the headers/content of the response

A contract is declared through the use of expect_request_and_respone('contract_name') in the context.

In practice most contracts will be generated via contract helpers, that allow you to use factories
to automatically generate the bulk of your json.
