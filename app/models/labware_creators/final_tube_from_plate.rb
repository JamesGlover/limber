  # This allows for additional sequencing work to be requested while libraries are still being made.
  # JG: We should check if there are other aspects of this that are depended on
  # This form is used to transfer directly from a plate into the final tubes.
  # The transfer template finds the mx tube corresponding to each well, and transfers into it. As a result,
  # pooling may happen at this stage.
  # The tubes are also passed automatically. This behaviour is a time-saving (for the users) measure based on limitations
  # of the existing pipeline, and may be removed in future. Essentially, as used currently, the tubes are ACTUALLY part
  # of the previous plate, so are already filled by this stage.
